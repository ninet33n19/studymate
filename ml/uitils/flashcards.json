      "question": "What is the A* algorithm?",
      "answer": "A* is a pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points on a graph. It uses a heuristic function to guide its search.",

      "source": "Content provided"
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean for A* to be 'admissible'?",
      "answer": "An admissible A* algorithm guarantees that it will find the shortest path to the goal, if a path exists. It requires that the heuristic function never overestimates the actual cost to reach the goal.",
      "topic": "A* Algorithm",
      "source": "Content provided"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does A* use a heuristic function?",
      "answer": "A* uses a heuristic function (h(n)) to estimate the cost from a node (n) to the goal. It combines this with the actual cost from the start to the node (g(n)) to prioritize nodes to explore.",

      "source": "Content provided"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is admissibility important for A*?",

      "source": "Content provided"
    },
    {
      "question": "How is the admissibility of A* proven?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What does 'bounding' refer to in Branch and Bound?",

      "source": "Branch & Bound text"
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Branch and Bound use the bounds to prune subproblems?",

      "source": "Branch & Bound text"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Branch and Bound considered a 'divide and conquer' strategy?",
      "answer": "Branch and Bound divides the original problem into smaller subproblems (divide) and then intelligently selects and evaluates (conquer) subproblems to systematically find the best possible solution, similar to how many divide-and-conquer algorithms work.",
